          Hello, I am Oleksii Butrin. This photo captures one of the happiest
          days of my life, my first flight as a co-pilot in a Cessna 172 in
          2021. At that time I was working as a project manager at a small Kyiv
          flight school and flight agency. I also had a humble home business —
          artisan hot sauces manufacture. The irony of fate is that both parts
          of my pre-war life — general aviation and entrepreneurship — are gone,
          at least until the end of the war. So I decided to remember my
          IT-youth and master the Frontend. With a basic knowledge of HTML and
          CSS, I began to improve these skills and also learned JavaScript and
          React in the early months of the war.
